I am thrilled to share my inaugural regression project, now available on GitHub. This project represents my introductory exploration into regression analysis, specifically centered around predicting house prices using linear regression. Leveraging the powerful scikit-learn library, I meticulously crafted and fine-tuned the linear regression model to achieve optimal predictive performance. The well-organized codebase, structured into directories like 'src,' 'data,' and 'results,' is designed for clarity and ease of understanding. Key highlights of the project include the calculation of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for assessing model accuracy and a comprehensive exploration of the dataset to identify significant predictors of house prices. To explore the project, simply clone the repository, install dependencies using 'pip,' and run the model using 'python src/main.py.' The 'results' folder houses essential metrics, including the MAE, providing a succinct summary of the model's performance. Additionally, the repository anticipates future improvements and acknowledges the datasets or resources that influenced and supported the project.
